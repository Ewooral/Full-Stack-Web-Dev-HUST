# Adding a Router

First thing to do is create a Browser Router and configure our first route. This will enable client side routing for our web app.

The main.jsx file is the entry point. Open it up and we'll put React Router on the page.

ðŸ‘‰ Create and render a browser router in main.jsx

`jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  RouterProvider,
  Route,
} from "react-router-dom";
import "./index.css";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <div>Hello world!</div>,
  },
]);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
`

This first route is what we often call the `root route`since the rest of our routes will render inside of it. It will serve as the root layout of the UI, we'll have nested layouts as we get farther along.


# The Root Route
Let's add the global layout for this app.

ðŸ‘‰ Create src/routes and src/routes/root.jsx

mkdir src/routes
touch src/routes/root.jsx
(If you don't want to be a command line nerd, use your editor instead of those commands ðŸ¤“)

ðŸ‘‰ Create the root layout component

`jsx

const Root = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>This is the Root Route</h1>
            <ul>
            <li>
              <a href={`contacts/1`}>Your Name</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href={`contacts/2`}>Your Friend</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </>
    )
}

`

ðŸ‘‰ Set <Root> as the root route's element

/* existing imports */
import Root from "./routes/root";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <Root />,
  },
]);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
