# Architecture of NodeJS
- Node core/ Standard library (JS)
- Node Bindings (c++)
- Chrome V8(c++), libuv(c)


# Node Package Manager
- NPM for short, manages the ecosystem of node modules / packages
- A package contains: 
	JS files
	package.json(manifest)



# Package.json
- serves as a documentation for what packages your project depends on
- allows you to specify the versions of a package that your project can use using 
  semantic versioning rules
- makes your build reproducible which means that it's way easier to share with other developers
