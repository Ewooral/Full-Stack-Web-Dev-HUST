The language used by World Wide Web hypertext documents is
called the `Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)`. HTML documents are as ASCII text
files, but are arranged using a special structure of HTML elements that define the
different parts of the document and how they should be displayed to the user. Each element
is described using special text tags that define it and its characteristics.
