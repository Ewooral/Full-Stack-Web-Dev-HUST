# what is DevOps?
DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools
that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services
at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than
organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure
management processes. 
This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers
and compete more effectively in the market. 


    DevOps is short for Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops). 
    Dev are the people and processes that create software.
    Ops are the teams and processes that deliver and monitor the software. 

# DevOps is a combination of:

Cultural philosophies for removing barriers and sharing end-to-end responsibility
Processes developed for speed and quality, that streamline the way people work
Tools that align with processes and automate repeatable tasks, making the
release process more efficient and the application more reliable


# NOTE
As you go through the course, keep in mind that teams practice DevOps
to increase innovation and agility, improve quality, release faster, and lower cost. 
DevOps improves delivery efficiency and predictability of the application and services.



# Problems with Traditional Development Practices
Traditional ways of developing software have proven slow and inefficient,
and fail to support teams' efforts to quickly deliver stable, high-quality applications. 
Challenges of Waterfall development, monolithic applications, manual processes, and
siloed team structures cause bottlenecks and delays.

## Waterfall development projects are 
slow, not iterative, resistant to change, 
and have long release cycles. 

	Some reasons for this include:

1. Requirements are rigid, set at project start, and will likely not change.
2. Development phases are siloed, each starting after the previous phase has ended. 
Each phase is supported by highly specialized teams.

Hand offs from one phase to the other are long, often requiring
teams to switch tools and spend time clarifying incomplete or ambiguous information.
3. Testing and security come after implementation, making corrective actions responsive and expensive.

	Manual processes throughout the application 
	lifecycle are slow, inconsistent, and error-prone. 
	For example, manually setting and configuring the infrastructure is time-consuming. 
	Manually repeating this process is no guarantee that a step will not be missed. 
	Another example is telling the developers to make sure their code is thoroughly
	tested before pushing it. Even with the best intentions, this manual process
	is slow, and does not preclude someone from forgetting a test or two.
