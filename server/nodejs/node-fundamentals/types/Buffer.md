# BUFFER

Is a node JS super data type. it is a Node JS addition to five primitives(boolean, string, number,
undefined and null) and all-encompassing objects

Node uses buffers when reading from a file system and
when receiving packets over the network.

It is analogous to javascript `ArrayBuffer`.
The class name `Buffer` is used to work with buffer objects.

To create a buffer object use `from`
